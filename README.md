> # Java Project
> ## Capstone Project
> - Develop simulation of the Car charging station with several alternative
sources of energy.
> - Several car charging stations are available with n location in it. Only one car
can be in one charging location. Charging one car takes a fixed time. If all
places are occupied, the car will not wait for more than a certain time and
will go to another car charging station.
> - Simulate the weather conditions to log the situation at the charging station
and switch between the energy sources.
> - Simulate the management system for the energy sources.
